# UnityVRTemplate
Unity template for VR projects. 

**Minimum Unity Version: 2020 LTS**

Based on this tutorial: https://www.lucashaley.com/how-to-create-a-new-unity-template-from-scratch.html

And the VR setup from Justing P Barnett's tutorials: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1yXfU3c2gXchdmscjvCmMQ

How to use:
-----------

1- Locate your Unity's templates folders. 

On Mac is something like: `/Applications/Unity/Hub/Editor/<VERSION>/Unity.app/Contents/Resources/PackageManager/ProjectTemplates`

On windows: `\Program Files\Unity\Hub\Editor\<VERSION>\Editor\Data\Resources\PackageManager\ProjectTemplates`

2- Put the tgz archive on there. 

3- Optional: Restart the hub if you had it open.

4- Open Unity Hub and you'll see the new template called VR.


How to create the tgz via command line:
---------------------------------------

Go to the folder where you downloaded this repo and execute this command: 
```
tar czf com.resistancestudio.template.vr-1.0.0.tgz package/
```

Enjoy!
